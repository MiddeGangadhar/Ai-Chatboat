My AI Chat Box😉

Once upon a web page... I decided to build an AI chat box. Why? Because chats are everywhere, and I wanted to make one that looks sleek and inviting. Using just HTML for the bones and CSS for the pretty colors and shapes, I created a simple chat window. It's not a real AI (yet!), but it feels like one when you open it.

Imagine this: You click open the page, and there's a box with messages popping up. It's like texting a friendly robot. No buttons to press or code to run – just view it in your browser and enjoy the design.

How did I do it? Straightforward: HTML set up the chat area, and CSS made it look modern with bubbles and fonts. I learned a ton about layouts and styles.

Why share this? To show off my web design skills and inspire others. If you're into coding, grab the code and tweak it. Add JavaScript later for real chat power!

Questions? Hit me up in the issues. Let's keep the conversation going!
